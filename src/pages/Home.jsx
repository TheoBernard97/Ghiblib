            Studio Ghibli, Inc. is a Japanese animation film studio based in
            Koganei, Tokyo, Japan. The studio is best known for its animated
            feature films, and has also produced several short films, television
            commercials, and one television film. It was founded on 15 June

            On 3 August 2014, Studio Ghibli temporarily halted production
            following the retirement of director Hayao Miyazaki, who co-founded
            the studio with the late Isao Takahata. In February 2017, Toshio
            Suzuki announced that Miyazaki had come out of retirement again to
            direct a new feature film, How Do You Live?, with Studio Ghibli.
